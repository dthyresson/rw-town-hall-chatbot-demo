# Redwood Copilot Demo
## with OpenAI and GraphQL Streaming

This project demonstrates how to use RedwoodJS, OpenAI and GraphQL Streaming to build a Chatbot that can answer questions about your code.

###
Codebase Generator
First we generate a file with your entire RedwoodJS project.

### OpenAI
We send that codebase to OpenAI and ask questions about it using our Redwood Copilot chatbot.

###GraphQL Streaming
Redwood Realtime with GraphQL Streaming will stream the response from OpenAI to the client.

## Todo

* Use Langbase instead of OpenAI directly
* Use RAG with RedwoodJS docs + AI assistant prompt to answer more questions.
